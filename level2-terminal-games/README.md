#  Level 2 - Build Your Own Terminal Game

Welcome to **Level 2**!

##  Task
In this level, you will **design and implement your own text-based terminal game** using **Bash**.

##  Requirements
- Your game must run entirely in the **terminal**.
- It must be written in **Bash** (no Python, C, or other languages).
- You should handle **user input**, **loops**, and **conditional logic**.
- Place your game in a folder named after your GitHub username inside this directory.

##  Example Game Ideas
- Tic Tac Toe (grid-based, two players)
- Hangman (guess the word by letters)
- Rock–Paper–Scissors (against the computer)
- Number Guessing Game (randomized number with hints)

You are **not limited** to these examples — feel free to create your own original terminal game!

##  How to Contribute
1. Create a new folder in this directory named after your GitHub username.  
   Example: `level2-terminal-games/<your-username>/`
2. Add your Bash game script inside your folder.  
   Example: `level2-terminal-games/<your-username>/tic-tac-toe.sh`
3. Add a short `README.md` inside your folder describing:
   - The rules of your game
   - How to run it
   - Example input/output

## 🎯 Goal
This task helps you practice **logic building, user input, and control flow** in Bash while having fun creating a playable terminal game.

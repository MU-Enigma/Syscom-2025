🎮​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ Game Rules: Rock, Paper, Scissors

Computer and you both select one option among Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

The winner is determined by these rules:

🪨 Rock wins over Scissors (Rock crushes Scissors)

📄 Paper wins over Rock (Paper covers Rock)

✂️ Scissors wins over Paper (Scissors cut Paper)

If both have the same option, it’s a draw.

After that, the game shows what the computer has chosen and if you have won, lost, or tied.

 (Optional) You may play again by running the script again or having a replay ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌loop.




 ⚙️ Game rules: Coin toss simulator

The game simulates tossing a fair coin.

Each toss has two possible outcomes:

Heads (H)

Tails (T)

You’ll be asked how many times you want to toss the coin.

The script will “flip” the coin that many times using random numbers.

After all tosses:

It displays each toss result (Heads/Tails).

It shows a summary of how many Heads and Tails appeared.

The results are random every time — no two runs are the same!

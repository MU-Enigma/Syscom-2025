🎮​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ Game Rules: Rock, Paper, Scissors

Computer and you both select one option among Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

The winner is determined by these rules:

🪨 Rock wins over Scissors (Rock crushes Scissors)

📄 Paper wins over Rock (Paper covers Rock)

✂️ Scissors wins over Paper (Scissors cut Paper)

If both have the same option, it’s a draw.

After that, the game shows what the computer has chosen and if you have won, lost, or tied.

 (Optional) You may play again by running the script again or having a replay ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌loop.

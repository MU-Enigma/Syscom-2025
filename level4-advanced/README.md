# Level 4 — Advanced Enhancements and Fixes

Welcome to **Level 4** !  
You’ve made it to the final stage — where you’ll act as a **maintainer** of the repository.

This level focuses on **finding and fixing unmentioned issues** and **improving existing functionality** in the version control system (VCS) codebase.  

---

##  Your Goal
Unlike Level 3, where tasks were predefined, Level 4 gives you **freedom and ownership** to explore, identify, and improve.

You are expected to:
- Find and fix **bugs or inefficiencies** in the code.  
- Refactor existing logic for better readability, speed, or maintainability.  
- Add **new features** or **enhancements** to make the system more robust.

##  How to Contribute

1. **Explore** the existing code in `level3-vcs/vcs.py`.  
2. **Identify** a bug or improvement.  
3. **Create a new branch** for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix/<short-description>
   ```
4. Implement your fix or feature.  
5. Test thoroughly before pushing.  
6. Commit your changes and open a PR describing what you fixed or improved.
